# Image_Classification_CNN
•Developed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images.
•Utilized image datasets and generators to preprocess and normalize the training and validation data for optimal model performance.
•Constructed a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers, dropout
regularization, and batch normalization to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
•Trained the model for 10 epochs, monitoring accuracy and loss on both training and validation data, and visualized the training progress.
